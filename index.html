         Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bold;"><i>Hamtendo's Restoration Shop</i></span>. This website offers many resources such as my story, tutorials,
         and tips on collecting! This is a great website for any beginner collector who wants to start collecting
         or wants to restore parts of their new collection. Everyone should start a sort of videogame collection
         because it offers many benefits! They are both great investments and a really fun way to make money too!
         Retro videogames go up in value over time and one of those brands to invest in would be <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nintendo!</span>
         Their products are one of a kind! They always retain their value.
         An example of this would be <span style="font-weight: bold;">GameCube</span> games that have all retained and even gained lots of value over these past 20 years!

   <!--My story in the retro videogame industry-->
   <u><h2>My Story</h2></u>

   <div>
      <p>
         I had initially started retro videogame collecting in 2018 when my friend was clearing out his
         house sold me his <span style="font-weight: bold;">GameCube</span> for $4. I didn't get into retro collecting much until September of
         2020 when another friend of mine was also clearing out his house and sold me his entire videogame
         collection of about 30 years for $30. This had started me into retro collecting and ever since I've
         been on the lookout for more <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nintendo</span> products and other retro videogame companies. Many of the consoles
         in my collection were defective and yellowed from old age. This had started my journey of the restoration
         aspect of videogames.

   <u><h2>My Intro to Repairing</h2></u>

   <!-- paragraph in a div container with some span styling -->
   <div>
      <p>
         When I started opening the consoles, with no previous experience in repairing electronics,
         I just tried to fix what seemed wrong. The first of these repairs was a normal <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gameboy</span> from
         the late <i>'80s</i>. My first repair was a success and from there I continued repairing and restoring
         the consoles. You can see some pictures of the repairs and restorations I've done below.
